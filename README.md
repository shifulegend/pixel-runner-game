```

### 📱 iPhone / iPad Shortcut
Download the [Spike Sprint iOS Shortcut](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shifulegend/spike-sprint/main/shortcuts/Spike-Sprint.shortcut) to launch the game in Safari with one tap — no server or browser navigation needed. It embeds the game as a base64 `data:text/html` URL and opens it locally.

## Gameplay

| Control | Action |
|---|---|
| `Space` / Tap / Click | Jump |
| Hold longer | Higher jump (max ~320ms) |

### Obstacles & Scoring

| Element | What it does |
|---|---|
| 👾 Enemy | Jump on top → **+100 score**. Sideways collision → game over |
| 🕳️ Pit | Fall in → instant game over |
| 🌿 Bush | Getting stuck triggers the barrel chaser |
| 🛢️ Spiked barrel | Surges when you're stuck. Game over when spike tip touches your left edge |

### Difficulty

Game speed scales automatically:

```
0–5 min   →   1× speed
5–10 min  →   2× speed  
10+ min   →   3× speed (max)
```

Score accrues proportionally to speed — the longer you survive, the faster the points.

## Tech Notes

- **Single file** — the entire game is `index.html`. Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript, zero external dependencies
- **HTML5 Canvas 2D API** — all sprites (player, enemy, barrel, bush) are procedurally drawn shapes, no external assets
- **Physics** — simple gravity + variable-height jump via hold-duration sampling
- **2× world zoom** — canvas scale transform gives a closer, more immersive view
- **Responsive** — canvas resizes to the browser window on load and resize
- **Web Audio API** — synthesized sound effects, cross-browser (Safari dummy-unlock pattern included)
- **Playwright CI** — automated smoke tests check for console errors, collision timing, and high score persistence before every release

## Origin Story

I was on a flight — no wifi, phone at 80%, and no in-flight entertainment system to save me. After landing, I said no more. A few days later, this game existed. It runs 100% offline (naturally), so next time you're stuck somewhere with no signal, you can be productively bored too.
